    <h1>Intro to Fractions</h1>
    <p><strong>What are Fractions?</strong></p>
    <p>In terms of mathematics and where it stands in the level of math and science, fractions are one step above normal mathematics and PMDAS (Parentheses, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction). The scientific idea of fractions is that it is a partition of a whole number. To bring the idea to real-world objects, fractions represent splitting them into “fractions.”</p>
    <p>Let's say a student is given a long ceramic board and needs to split it into equal parts for both him and his partner for a project.</p>
    <img src="https://ryantschool.github.io/RyanTSchoolgithub.io/lessons/Algebra/AlgFractions1.PNG" alt="Ceramic board">
    <p>We can easily say, he can split the board in two so both he and his partner have a slab of ceramic board.</p>
    <img src="https://ryantschool.github.io/RyanTSchoolgithub.io/lessons/Algebra/AlgFractions2.PNG" alt="Split ceramic board">
    <p>Now then, what if we want to split the board so that both members of the team have enough to do multiple attempts with them? Well, we can split the board some more. For now, let's split the board so both members have 3 boards to work with.</p>

    <h2>Identifying Fractions of Objects</h2>
    <p>When working with equations that involve fractions, you may come across fractions such as these:</p>
    <p><sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>. We can visualize this fraction as shown:</p>
    <img src="https://ryantschool.github.io/RyanTSchoolgithub.io/lessons/Algebra/AlgFractions4.PNG" alt="Fraction 7/9 visualization">
    <p>Fractions can also be identified by visual images, such as this:</p>
    <img src="https://ryantschool.github.io/RyanTSchoolgithub.io/lessons/Algebra/AlgFractions5.PNG" alt="Fraction 5/8 visualization">
    <p>We can easily see that this represents <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>.</p>

        <tr>
            <td><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub></td>
            <td>Image 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></td>
            <td>Image 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></td>
            <td>Image 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></td>
            <td>Image 4</td>
        </tr>

    <h4>Finding Equivalent Fractions</h4>
    <p>When working with equations that involve fractions, you may come across fractions such as these:</p>
    <p><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>, <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>11</sub>, <sup>17</sup>&frasl;<sub>19</sub></p>
    <p>Some fractions can even come in much larger numbers such as these:</p>
    <p><sup>8</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>, <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub>, <sup>9</sup>&frasl;<sub>63</sub></p>
    <p>However, these fractions are different from the ones given in the first set of fractions. Unlike the first set of fractions, the second set of fractions can be simplified, changed down into smaller fractions that can be easy to work with. For example:</p>
